# Tennis Match Prediction Project Overview

This project aims to predict the outcomes of tennis matches by leveraging historical match data. The dataset includes ATP match data from 2000 to 2024, and the project involves feature engineering, data processing, and model training to build a prediction system.

## Project Structure

### Data Collection

- **Source**: ATP match data from 2000 to 2024 from the Jeff Sackmann Tennis Data Repository.
- **Process**: 
  - Check if data files exist locally and download them if necessary.
  - Concatenate and sort the data chronologically.

### Data Preparation

- **Splitting Data**: 
  - Divided into three subsets: `initial_50`, `next_25`, and `final_25`.
- **Player Class**: 
  - Tracks player statistics and performance, including match statistics, win streaks, head-to-head records, and surface performance.
- **Feature Engineering**: 
  - The `create_features` function generates additional features such as rank differences, win percentages, and surface preferences.
- **Handling Missing Values**: 
  - Fill missing values with appropriate placeholders or statistical values to ensure data completeness.

### Model Building

- **Feature Encoding**: 
  - Categorical features are encoded using `LabelEncoder`.
  - Numerical features are scaled using `StandardScaler`.
- **Model Training**: 
  - Split the dataset into training and test sets.
  - Train and evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score.

## How to Use

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Run the script to download and process the ATP match data. The data will be stored in the `tennis_datav2` directory.
2. **Feature Engineering**: 
   - Use the `create_features` function to generate features from the match data.
3. **Model Training**: 
   - Train and evaluate models using the prepared data and features.

## Dependencies

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`

## Future Work

- **Model Improvement**: 
  - Explore advanced machine learning models and techniques to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Data Expansion**: 
  - Include shot-by-shot data to gain deeper insights into player performance.
- **Performance Tuning**: 
  - Optimize model parameters and perform feature selection to improve performance.
