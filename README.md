Tennis Match Prediction Project
Overview
This project aims to predict the outcomes of tennis matches by leveraging historical match data. The dataset includes ATP match data from 2000 to 2024, and the project involves feature engineering, data processing, and model training to build a prediction system.

Project Structure
Data Collection
The code collects ATP match data from 2000 to 2024 from the Jeff Sackmann Tennis Data Repository. It checks if the data files exist locally and downloads them if necessary. The data is then concatenated and sorted chronologically.

Data Preparation
Splitting Data: The data is divided into three subsets: initial_50, next_25, and final_25.
Player Class: A Player class is used to track player statistics and performance. This includes match statistics, win streaks, head-to-head records, and surface performance.
Feature Engineering: The create_features function generates additional features such as rank differences, win percentages, and surface preferences.
Handling Missing Values: Missing values are filled with appropriate placeholders or statistical values to ensure data completeness.
Model Building
Feature Encoding: Categorical features are encoded using LabelEncoder, and numerical features are scaled using StandardScaler.
Model Training: The dataset is split into training and test sets. Models are trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score.
How to Use
Data Collection: Run the script to download and process the ATP match data. The data will be stored in the tennis_datav2 directory.
Feature Engineering: Use the create_features function to generate features from the match data.
Model Training: Train and evaluate models using the prepared data and features.
Dependencies
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
Future Work
Model Improvement: Explore advanced machine learning models and techniques to enhance prediction accuracy.
Data Expansion: Include shot-by-shot data to gain deeper insight into player performance.
Performance Tuning: Optimize model parameters and perform feature selection to improve performance.
